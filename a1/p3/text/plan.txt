Causal broadcast is nothing bt causal delivery implemented at any process

Causal delivery is nothing but imlementing the delivery rule DR3
	deliver a message m  from process p_j as soon as both the conditions are satisfied:
		D[j] = TS(m)[j]-1
		D[k] >= TS(m)[k], for all k notequal to j
	when p0 delivers m, array D is updated by setting D[j] to TS(m)[j].
	p0 maintains an array of counters D[1...n] of counters initially all zeros, st D[i] contains TS(m_i)[i] where m_i is the last message that has been delivered from process p_i.


p0 wants to send causal broadcast


	ports.txt is as follows;
a row is list of outgoing ports for that rows process.
so if a process p0 has to send to p1, it queries for ports[0][1]
